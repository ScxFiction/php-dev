# Change docker project name

The Docker project name is generated by the current folder.

```text
Project name: {current-folder}_{service}_{id}

/my-project/docker-compose.yml, container: web
Project name: my-project_web_1
```

However, if the folder name is the same as another project, there is a problem and a container shuts down.

To fix this, you can specify the project name itself in the ``.env`` file:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my-project1_www
```

After starting both containers:

```text
/my-project1/www/docker-compose.yml, container: web
Project name: my-project1_www_web_1

/my-project2/www/docker-compose.yml, container: web
Project name: my-project2_www_web_1
```
